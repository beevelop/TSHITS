# T-SHITS ðŸ‘•ðŸ’©
## The Self-Hosted, Independent Technology Stack 

Around 4 years ago, I started developing and maintaining my personal, self-hosted technology stack and wrote a bunch of Docker-Compose files. I wanted to host awesome tools like GitLab, Metabase, Jira, Huginn, Monica, Bitwarden, Cabot, Confluence, OpenVPN, Nexus, Redash, Rundeck, Weblate, Zabbix and even more on my own infrastructure.

In the light of the [recent announcement](https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-the-compose-specification/) from Docker to develop the **Compose Specification**, I like to contribute **T**he **S**elf-**H**osted, **I**ndependent **T**echnology **S**tack to the community.

> :warning: Some of the Docker-Compose files are over 2 years old and might not work with the most recent versions of the referenced Docker images. Feel free to raise an issue, if you stumble upon something. :v:

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker and Docker-Compose installed on your machine.

## Installation

To use the services and start spinning up your own T-SHITS services, you just need to clone (or fork if you like to) this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/beevelop/TSHITS.git
```

## Usage

Every service has a helper `./bee.sh` file. Just navigate to your favorite service and execute one of the helper functions:
```
Usage: ./bee COMMAND [options]

Commands:
    prepare   Prepares the service for launch (e.g. folders, files, configs,...)
    launch    Launches the service (overwrite with do_launch)
    health    Checks if the service is running properly
    up [ENV]  Prepares, launches and checks the service for the provided ENV

Helpers:
    encrypt [ENV]  Encrypts the .env file for the provided ENV
    decrypt [ENV]  Decrypts the .env file for the provided ENV
    upgrade   Upgrade a service (combines backup and up)

DANGERZONE (don't mess with this shit... seriously):
    nuke      Kills the service and removes all traces (image, files, configs,...)
```

## Services
